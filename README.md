## üóíÔ∏è Project Intro/Objective
The LRT or the Light Rail Transit is an urban rail transit system in the Philippines. The Light Rail Transit Authority's (LRTA) goal is to create a mass transit rail network to help fix traffic congestion and carbon footprint. 

The Key Performance Indicators (KPI) of the LRT that they show to the public are reports of how the government-owned corporation is doing in terms of reliability and efficiency.

As of May 2023, the objective of this project is to predict the KPI's for the rest of 2023 based on previous data that the corporation has shared on their website.
